							<li>Bugs Bunny entered the rocket through the engine</li>

					<h3>What should have happened</h3>
						<ul class="bullets">
							<li>Can't enter through this way</li>
							<li>Impossible to do. The velocity required to make that trip in 30 seconds (how long it took in the movie) is 7,510,000,000 based off of d=vt, which is faster than the speed of light</li>
							<li>Bugs would explode if he went into space without some sort of space suit due to the change in pressure</li>
							<li>The building, along with the people on it, would be pulled down from Mars's gravitational force</li>
							<li>Based off of the images Bugs should have never went backwards and instead continued to go forward</li>
							<li>Explosion isn't even the size of a nuclear explosion, which can't even destroy the earth. Even if it had the fire power to destroy the world, it would not reach the earth in time</li>
